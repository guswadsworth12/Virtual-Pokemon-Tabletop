# Virtual Pokemon Tabletop
Software designed specifically for running PTU on the internet.  

This came to me as an idea after I was running my own game with some friends when i killed the game from being incompetent with the battle mechanics.  

So, when I went to make this I decided to take the useful features from Roll20.net and add them to the base of this software so that people don’t need to pay for the premium to use those features.

## Contribution
Want to help? Just make a fork and follow these rules

1: Code needs to be Commented, Documented, Formatted and Tested.  
2: Changes made need to be made in the "Alpha" Branch. This is where all the latest changes are.  
3: Pull request into the "Alpha" branch, I will look and accept it there.  

All help would be appreciated. and this project is done in C# Using WPF.
