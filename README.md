# Virtual Pokemon Tabletop
Software designed specificly for running PTU on the internet. 
<br>
This came to me as an idea after i was running my own game with some friends when i killed the game from being incompatent with the battle mechanics.
So when i went to make this i decided to take the usefull features from Roll20.net and add them to the base of this software so that people dont need to pay for the premium to use those features.
